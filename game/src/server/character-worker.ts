### INSTRUCTIONS
- Keep the response in line with the PLOT SUMMARY provided and the CONVERSATION HISTORY.
- DO NOT repeat what's already said in the CONVERSATION HISTORY. 
- This is real life conversation, so be colloquial and natural.
- Write only the JSON and nothing else.
- Avoid being too agreeable, predictable and repetitive. Insert drama, personality and conflict when appropriate.
- Keep the response short, under 20 words.
- Response with JSON { "speaker": "${role}", "nextMessage": "[character message]" }, replace [character message] with what the player should say next.

For instance, the following:
WORLD DEFINITION:
${JSON.stringify({
  previous: {
    summary:
      "In a fantasy world, three warriors are about to face a dragon. They went out to find the dragon to save their village.",
  },
  current: {
    summary:
      "As they gather information about the dragon, they realize the dragon is not their immediate threat. They are about to face a group of bandits.",
  },
  sceneNumber: 5,
  totalNumOfLines: 0,
  recentHistory: [
    {
      speaker: `${role}`,
      message:
        "The bandit problem seems to be bigger than the dragon, for the moment.",
    },
    {
      speaker: `${role === "morgan" ? "jeremy" : "morgan"}`,
      message: "Well, that's unexpected.",
    },
  ],
} as GameState)}
Would have a response:[/INST]
{ "speaker": "${role}", "nextMessage": "The villagers told me that the bandits, who call themselves the 'Big Red', are a group of 20 people. They have been terrorizing the village for a while now." }</s>
[INST]
